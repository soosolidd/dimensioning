        <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Welcome to the official website created to propose a new skill for the MMORPG Old-school Runescape: Dimensioning!

        <p>Dimensioning focuses on players completing various tasks around Gilenor, within an instanced environment,
            to gain experience in both the dimensioning skill and the by-product skills. The items obtained during this skill
            will be used as reworks for each of the other skills in the game, to better balance and maintain game integrity.
            Players will interact with travelers which will teleport them to a different dimension (in-game instance). Within this dimension,
            the traveler will assign you a task and a specified amount of time to complete this task before the dimension closes. 
            The faster or more efficient the task is completed, the better rewards and experience the player recieves!
            <br></br>
            This skill is designed to allow players to train other skills passively and be highly rewarded in doing so. Dimenioning involves
            item sinks to help balance the in-game economy and is designed to bridge the income gap between PVM and skillers.
            It is important to incentivize players to skill using non-traditional methods, which is why this skill will focus on new
            styles of gathering experince and resources that isn't too repetitive. 
            <br></br>
            If this sounds exiciting to you, more information can be found in the <a href="#toc">table of contents</a> provided below.
            Please spread the word about this project and if you have any suggestions, feel free to reachout through the <a href="discord.html">discord</a> 
            or <a href="about_us.html">about us</a> section of this website. This is a community project and will need every vote we can to get this 
            skill implemented without adversely changing the way OSRS is played.
            
        </p>
        <img src="design_pillars.png" class="center2">
        <p>1. The addition of dimensioning will solve many of the current issues within the core of the game. The economy of OSRS has been 
            heavily influenced by the oversaturation of supplies throughout the game. Many items that once had value, such as a whip, do not
            give the players the same reaction when they recieve it as a drop because there are so many in the game and no longer are worth 
            as much. This skill has unique items that allow players to sink items out of the game to gain a small boost in experience in
            certain skills or a quality of life reward. The gap between PVM and skillers has torn the OSRS community apart; the vast majority
            of money makers in game are PVM. Players can make over 20M gp/h doing solo TOA while the max a skiller can make is around 2.5m gp/h 
            in thieving or agility. This skill does not attempt to negatively impact any variety of player but is attempting to allow all 
            players a way to be competitive within the OSRS economy, without solely PVM. Players will have 12 different travelers in locations
            all around Gilenor that will teleport them into a dimension and bring back <a href="rewards.html">unique items</a> to create a better experience for all 
            players.<br></br>

            2. Dimensioning allows players to progress their accounts in ways no other skills can. Each of the travelers will assign a player
            a task that will require a combination of skills to complete. This means as players train dimensioning, they will be leveling up
            on average 4 different skills as a by-product. The more efficient the player is during the instanced event, the more rewarding it
            is for the player. Players will dedicate themselves to unlocking certain skill levels so they can access certain travelers. Every 
            8 levels in dimensioning, players will unlock a new traveler however, there will be requirements for the skills being tested within
            the instance. The unique items obtained in this skill will allow players to progress their OSRS accounts with slightly faster exp
            in a few skills and/or make them less intensive/repetitve. With many different <a href="skill_breakdown.html">travelers</a>, in 
            various regions, players will not be spending too much time in one specific location doing one specific task. <br></br>

            3. This skill appeals to all types of players but primarily the skillers are the ones that benefit the most. PVM will be involved
            in certain dimensions and some of the rewards from the dimensions will be involved in PVP. There are dimensions that are very 
            afkable while other dimensions will be very intense. Players will not be required to have supplies in certain dimensions while 
            other dimensions may allow players to bring in items. All players in OSRS will be effected by this skill in one way or another.<br></br>

            4. Skills are given an alternative way to train which will allow players to choose which way is more enjoyable for them. The
            instances will make the players interact with OSRS like never before as they will be challenged within a certain amount of time 
            to do the best they can at completing a task. Dimensioning will not provide the fastest experience in game of any skill, however 
            rewarding players with unique items that help boost their accounts will be a very enjoyable process.
