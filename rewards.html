            <img src="gravity_boots.png" class="img_padding" height="25px" width="25px">
            Gravity robe set works as a set effect where you must have all 5 items equipped in order to recieve any benefits from 
            it. In addition to the new prayer book, there will be 3 new prayers in game that allow the player to gain significant
            equipment bonuses depending on which prayer they are using. The stats will be similar, both offensively and defensively,
            to the current BIS equipment; Masori, Nex and Ancestral. The armor changes color depending on which prayer is being used
            (green for range, blue for mage and red for melee). Players need 70 defense to wield.
            <br></br>
            For example, a player can wield the robe set and pray the melee prayer and get bonuses similar to full Nex then they
            could swap to the range prayer and immedietley get bonuses similar to full Masouri, without having to swap any armor
            pieces. 
            
            There will still be a gap in the meta because players risking full Nex or Masouri would be able to get bonuses
            from gloves and boots slots; two slots the gravity robe set loses. Additionally, players using gravity robes will not
            be able to use any prayers in the game, outside of protection prayers (protect item can't be used). This will force a 
            higher risk in a pvp scenerio.
            <br></br>
            For example, a player could hybrid with mage and range, only bringing in two weapons: dragon crossbow and toxic Staff.
            Player could swap between these two items, similtenously with the combat prayers to get bonuses as if they are wearing 
            Ancestral and Masori. If that player is killed, they will lose both items since they have strong bonuses compared to 
            what they would lose if they brought in those armor pieces, seperatley.
            <br></br>
            This will heavily increase the complexity of pvp and can be a great set of armor for players to go for mid to late game
            in pvm. The risk from the player will be from the weapons they bring into the wild and having to rely on maintaining high
            prayer while fighting. The prayers will drain 50 points/min (10 points faster than Piety). This item will be tradeable
            and obtained while completing dimensions. When a player dies in the wild with these robes, the pieces will be uncharged,
            creating a sink for the pvm items required to charge each of the pieces again.
